<Note>
  In order to get TicketPilot running on your server, follow these simple steps. Be sure to have Administrator permissions on your server before
  proceeding.
</Note>

## Step One:

It's essential to enable **Community Features** on your Discord Server, as the bot will not work properly without it. Here's how to switch your server to a community server:

1. Open your **Server Settings**.
2. Scroll down and select **Community**.
3. Click **Enable Community** and follow the promts to complete the setup.

Make sure you meet the necessary requirements, like enabling verified emails and explicit content filtering.

## Step Two (optional):

<Note>
  This step is optional and can be directly done in the setup process on the website. However, if you prefer to set up the channels manually, follow
  these steps.
</Note>

To manage all support requests, you'll need to set up two channels:

1. **Forum Channel** (For ticket storage)&#x20;

- Go to your server and click the **Create Channel** button.
- Choose **Forum** as the channel type.
- Name the channel (e.g., "Support Tickets" or "Help Requests").
- Set appropriate permissions for your support staff.
- Once created, this will be the dedicated space where every support ticket will be logged and managed.

2. **Ticket Creation Channel** (for opening tickets)

- Create a **Text Channel**, e.g., "Support".

<Warning>
  In this channel, your bot will post an embedded message containing a button that users can click to open a new ticket. Once clicked, the user will
  be guided through the ticket creation process in their DMs.&#x20;
</Warning>

## Step Three:&#x20;

Navigate to the server selection field on TicketPilot's website. You'll see a list of servers you manage. Select the server you want to invite the bot to by clicking **"Add"** next to the server name.
Once selected, you'll be prompted to grant the bot the necessary permissions. Make sure **not to modify** these permissions, as they are essential for proper bot functionality.

## Step Four:

Now, you can choose a preset that includes categories, tags, and other settings for your tickets. While it's optional, we **highly recommend** selecting a preset to simplify setup.

After choosing (or skipping) the preset, you'll need to configure two channels:&#x20;

- **Ticket Embed Channel**: Select the text channel you created earlier (e.g., "Support") where the bot will post the ticket creation embed.&#x20;
- **Ticket Forum**: Choose the forum channel (e.g., "Help Requests") where tickets will be logged and managed.

## All set!

And that's it, you're ready to use TicketPilot! Feel free to test your new setup by clicking the "**Request Ticket**" button in the "**Support"** channel.
This will open a ticket directly in your **DMs**, allowing you to experience the ticket creation process and ensure everything is working smoothly with TicketPilot.
