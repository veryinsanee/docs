<Note>
  In order to get TicketPilot running on your server, follow these simple steps. Be sure to have Administrator permissions on your server before
  proceeding.
</Note>

## Enabling the Community Feature

It's essential to enable **`Community Features`** on your Discord Server, as the bot will not work properly without it. Here's how to switch your server to a community server:

1. Open your **`Server Settings`**.
2. Scroll down and select **`Community`**.
3. Click **`Enable Community`** and follow the prompts to complete the setup.

Make sure you meet the necessary requirements, like enabling verified emails and explicit content filtering.

## Adding the bot to the server

Navigate to the server selection field on TicketPilot's website. You'll see a list of servers you manage. Select the server you want to invite the bot to by clicking **`Add`** next to the server name.
Once selected, you'll be prompted to grant the bot the necessary permissions. Make sure **not to modify** these permissions, as they are essential for proper bot functionality.

## Setting the bot up

<Note>
  This step is required, but it's optional to let the system automatically create the channels for you. If you prefer to do it manually, simply uncheck the box and manually set up the channels and permission yourself.
</Note>

Now you can choose a preset that includes categories, tags, and other settings for your tickets. While it's optional, we **highly recommend** selecting a preset to simplify setup.

The system will automatically check the **`Let the bot create the channels for me`** option, which will create the necessary channels for you, such as:

- **`Ticket Embed Channel:`** This is where the bot will post the ticket creation embed (e.g., in the `Support` channel).

- **`Ticket Forum:`** This is the forum where tickets will be logged and managed (e.g., `Help Requests`).

<Warning>
  Your bot will post an embedded message containing a select field that users can click to open a new ticket. Once clicked, the user will open a ticket in their DMs.
</Warning>

## All set!

And that's it, you're ready to use **TicketPilot**! Feel free to test your new setup by selecting a ticket category in the support channel.
This will open a ticket directly in your **DMs**, allowing you to experience the ticket creation process and ensure everything is working smoothly with TicketPilot.
