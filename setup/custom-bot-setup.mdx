## Step One: Create Your Custom Bot

1. **Log in to the Discord Developer Portal**
   Visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord account.

2. **Create a `New Application`**

   1. Click on **`New Application`** in the top right.

   2. Give your bot a unique name (this will be its name on your server).

   3. Once done, click **`Create`**.

3. **Generate a Bot Token**

   1. On the left sidebar, navigate to the **`Bot`** tab.

   2. Click **`Add Bot`** and confirm the action.

   3. Under **`Token`**, click **`Copy`** to save your bot token somewhere safe. You'll need this later, but never share it publicly!

4. **Set Up Bot Permissions**

   1. Scroll down to the **`Privileged Gateway Intents`** section.

   2. Enable **`SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`** and **`MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`** (these are required for TicketPilot to function properly).

## Step Two: Add the Bot to Your Server

Once you've created your custom bot, it's time to add it to your server and configure its appearance and settings. Here's how to do it:

### Step 2.1: Access the `Bot Personalizer`

* Navigate to **`Configuration`** > **`Bot Personalizer`** in the TicketPilot dashboard.

### Step 2.2: Authentication

* In the **`Authentication`** section, enter the bot's **`Bot Token`** and **`Client ID`** that you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.

### Step 2.3: Customize Bot Appearance

In the **`Appearance`** section, customize your bot's profile:

* **`Bot Name`**: Set your bot's name (e.g., `TicketPilot.me`).

* **`Activity Text`**: This is the text that will appear when your bot is "playing" or "watching" something (e.g., `Watching [https://ticketpilot.me](https://www.ticketpilot.me)`).

* **`Bot Image URL`**: Add a link to your bot's profile picture by providing an image URL.

* **`Bot Status`**: Set your bot's status (e.g., `Online`, `Idle`, etc.).

* **`Activity Type`**: Choose from options like `Playing`, `Streaming`, or `Watching` to display the bot's activity.

You will also see a **`Bot Preview`** on the right side that will give you a live look at how your bot will appear on Discord.

### Step 2.4: Invite the Bot to Your Guild

* Once you have saved the bot's token and customized its appearance, click on the **`Invite Bot to Guild`** button.

* This will open a new window where you can invite your custom bot to your server. Follow the steps, ensuring you grant all necessary permissions for proper functionality.

### Step 2.5: Enable the Bot

* After inviting the bot to your server, click the **`Enable Bot`** button to activate it.
