## Help Desk Overview

The **HelpDesk** feature in TicketPilot allows staff members to provide quick and accurate answers to common questions by using predefined or automatically fetched solutions. This feature can reduce the need for manual intervention, improving response times for frequently asked questions.

### Auto Fetching

With **Auto Fetching**, the system can automatically pull messages from a specific channel and store them as potential solutions. These solutions can be sent by staff members in two ways:

- **Manually**, by selecting them when using the `/help` command inside a ticket.
- **Automatically**, through the `OCR Scanner` or `PilotAI` features, which analyze user queries and suggest the most relevant solutions.

To enable auto-fetching:

1. Toggle `Auto Fetching Enabled`.
2. Select a `Fetch Channel` where solutions will be retrieved from.
3. Click `Save Settings`.

### Static Solutions

**Static Solutions** are predefined answers set up by the staff. Staff members can access these solutions by using the `/help` command within an open ticket. The system will display an overview of all the static solutions, allowing the staff to select one, which will then be posted as an embed within the ticket.

- To create a solution, click the `Add Solution` button, enter the solution's `Name` and `Content`, and click `Create`.
- These static solutions provide consistent, pre-approved answers that can be sent to users quickly.

By combining **Auto Fetching** and **Static Solutions**, your staff can manage support more efficiently and ensure users receive accurate information.
