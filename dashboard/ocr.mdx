## OCR Feature Overview

The **OCR Feature** in TicketPilot allows the bot to detect and analyze text within images uploaded by users in tickets. When a match is found with a predefined trigger, the bot will automatically respond with the assigned solution, ensuring fast and accurate support.

### OCR Triggers

OCR triggers are created to scan for specific text in images uploaded to tickets. When the bot detects a match, it will send the corresponding solution. This helps automate and streamline responses for common issues without requiring manual intervention.

- **Content to Detect**: Input the text content you want to detect. If you want to detect multiple terms, use a format like `content1;content2;content3` to specify all relevant terms.
- **Select Help Solution**: Choose the predefined solution that will be sent when a trigger is matched.

### Adding OCR Triggers

1. Click `Add Trigger`.
2. In the **Content to Detect** field, enter the text or phrases the bot should scan for.
3. Select the relevant help solution that will be sent when the text is detected.
4. Save the trigger by clicking `Add Trigger`.

This feature significantly improves efficiency by responding automatically to user-uploaded content, reducing the workload on your support team.
