## Smart Tags Overview  

Smart Tags in **TicketPilot** help organize tickets based on their current status or specific server needs. These tags can either be automatically applied by the system or manually created by staff.

---

### Waiting Tags  
The system automatically updates waiting tags based on the last message in the Discord ticket channel:

- **`Waiting for User`**: If the last message was sent by staff, the system sets the ticket to `Waiting for User`, signaling that the staff is waiting for a user response.  
- **`Waiting for Staff`**: If the last message was sent by the user, the system automatically updates the tag to `Waiting for Staff`, indicating that the ticket is awaiting staff action.

This automatic system helps staff quickly identify which tickets need attention and which are awaiting a response from the user.

### Custom Tags  
Staff can create custom tags to categorize tickets based on specific needs or internal workflows. These custom tags are fully customizable with the following options:

- **`Tag Name`**: Set the name of the tag.  
- **`Emoji`**: Choose an emoji for easy identification.  
- **`Roles to Mention`**: Optionally mention specific roles when a tag is applied for better visibility.  

To create a custom tag, click the **`+`** button and fill in the required fields. Custom tags make it easier to manage tickets that fall outside of the typical waiting statuses.
