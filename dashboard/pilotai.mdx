## Tone Rewriter

The **Tone Rewriter** allows you to standardize the tone of outgoing messages sent by staff members in tickets.

### Global Configuration

1. Go to the `Tone Rewriter` tab under PilotAI.

2. Select a **Tone Preset** from the dropdown menu, such as Friendly, Professional, or Casual.

   * This setting applies to all tickets by default.

### Ticket-Specific Tone

If a different tone is required for a specific ticket, you can override the global setting using the `/tone` command directly within the ticket. This creates an exception (similar to the "lex specialis" principle) and ensures that tone rewriting for that ticket is adjusted accordingly.

### Manual Rewriting

Use the `/rewrite` command in Discord to manually rewrite a specific message. You can choose a tone on-the-fly for the rewritten text, making it easy to adapt your communication style as needed.

## Real-Time Translations

The **Real-Time Translations** feature automatically translates incoming and outgoing messages within tickets, ensuring smooth communication across language barriers.

### Force Incoming Language

1. Navigate to the `Realtime Translations` tab.

2. Use the `Force Incoming Language` dropdown to set a default language for all incoming messages.

   * For example, selecting "German" ensures all incoming messages are translated to German.

### Force Outgoing Language

1. Use the `Force Outgoing Language` dropdown to set a default language for all outgoing messages.

   * For example, selecting "English" ensures that all staff responses are translated into English.

### Ticket-Specific Language Settings

If specific language rules are required for a ticket, use the `/language` command. This applies only to the ticket where the command is executed, overriding global language settings.

## SmartFocus

The **SmartFocus** feature automates responses by understanding user intentions and sending predefined solutions.

### Setting Up a SmartFocus Trigger

1. Navigate to the `SmartFocus` tab in PilotAI.

2. Click `Add Trigger`.

3. Enter the **Intention to Detect**, such as "I can't log in."

4. Select the corresponding **Help Solution** from the dropdown (configured in the Help Desk feature).

5. Save the trigger.

When PilotAI detects a matching intention in user messages, it automatically sends the selected Help Solution, reducing the need for manual intervention.
