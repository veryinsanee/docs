The **Configuration** section allows you to customize key settings for your guild and the messages TicketPilot sends. Here’s an overview of what you can manage:

### Guild Settings

In the **Guild Settings** tab, you can configure essential settings for your ticketing system. This includes:

* **`Ticket Forum`**: Select the forum channel where all tickets will be logged and managed (e.g., `help-requests`). If there are no available channels, ensure that a forum channel is created directly within Discord, then reload the page to display it here.

***

### Messages Configuration

In the **Messages** tab, you can customize the system-generated messages that TicketPilot sends. You can:

* **`Select Message to Edit`**: Choose which system message you want to modify (e.g., `Ticket Opened Message`).

* **Message Placeholders**: Use dynamic placeholders to make the messages more personalized, such as:

  * **`Ticket Creator User ID`** (`%user_id%`): Inserts the ID of the ticket creator.

  * **`Ticket Creator User Name`** (`%user_name%`): Displays the ticket creator’s username.

  * **`Category Label`** (`%category_label%`): Shows the category label for the ticket.

* **Live Preview**: A real-time preview of the message or embed is displayed on the right side, so you can see how it will look in Discord.

### **Commands**

This section allows you to assign permissions for different commands available in TicketPilot. You can:

* **Assign Roles**: Specify which roles can access a command.

* **Command Overview**: A list of all commands with a brief description of their function (e.g., `/help`, `/close`).

### **Blacklisted Users**

Use this page to manage a blacklist for your guild. Here’s what you can do:

* **Add Entry**: Add a user to the blacklist by their username or ID.

* **Filter Options**: Filter blacklisted users by reason or date range.

* **Remove Entry**: Unlist users when required.

### **Bot Personalizer**

Customize the appearance and basic behavior of your bot in Discord.
