## Ticket Forum
- This dropdown menu lets you select the forum channel where all tickets will be logged and managed. Choose the appropriate forum (e.g., "help-requests") to organize ticket discussions. If there are no available channels listed, ensure that a forum channel is created directly within Discord and then reload the page to display it here.
