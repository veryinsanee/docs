The **Configuration** section allows you to customize key settings for your guild and the messages TicketPilot sends. Here’s an overview of what you can manage:

### Guild Settings

In the **Guild Settings** tab, you can configure essential settings for your ticketing system. This includes:

* **`Ticket Forum`**: Select the forum channel where all tickets will be logged and managed (e.g., `help-requests`). If there are no available channels, ensure that a forum channel is created directly within Discord, then reload the page to display it here.

***

### Messages Configuration

In the **Messages** tab, you can customize the system-generated messages that TicketPilot sends. You can:

* **`Select Message to Edit`**: Choose which system message you want to modify (e.g., `Ticket Opened Message`).

* **Message Placeholders**: Use dynamic placeholders to make the messages more personalized, such as:

  * **`Ticket Creator User ID`** (`%user_id%`): Inserts the ID of the ticket creator.

  * **`Ticket Creator User Name`** (`%user_name%`): Displays the ticket creator’s username.

  * **`Category Label`** (`%category_label%`): Shows the category label for the ticket.

* **Live Preview**: A real-time preview of the message or embed is displayed on the right side, so you can see how it will look in Discord.
