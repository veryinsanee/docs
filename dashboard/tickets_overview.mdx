## Ticket List

In this area, you can view all tickets created on your server, with options to filter by various criteria:

- **State**: Tickets are categorized as either `Open` or `Closed` to help you track their status at a glance.
- **Creator**: Displays the username of the individual who opened the ticket.
- **Category**: Shows the category under which the ticket was created, such as `Product Testing` or `General Support`.
- **Created At**: The exact time and date when the ticket was opened.
- **Actions**: You can click the `View in Discord` button to jump directly into the corresponding Discord conversation for any ticket.

Additionally, the system allows filtering by `State`, `Creator`, `Category`, and `Date Range` to quickly locate specific tickets or review historical data.

## Transcript Overview

For each ticket, a transcript of the conversation is automatically generated and can be accessed while the ticket is still `Open` or after it has been `Closed`. 

### Features:

- **View Transcript**: A detailed history of the conversation is presented, showing every message exchanged between the user and the support team.
  
- **Sync with Open Tickets**: The transcript updates in real-time, allowing you to review the ongoing conversation even if the ticket hasn’t been closed yet.
  
- **Download Transcript**: A `Download Transcript` button allows you to save a local copy of the conversation for record-keeping or offline review.

## User Profile Access

From the ticket or transcript view, you can click on the creator’s profile to see their full user details:

- **Profile Overview**: Displays key information such as the user's name, user ID, server roles, and the number of tickets they have opened.
  
- **Ticket History**: Provides a summary of all tickets created by the user, allowing support staff to track patterns of requests.
  
- **Tickets by Category**: A breakdown of the tickets the user has opened, categorized for easier identification of recurring issues or common topics.

By having quick access to both the user's history and open tickets, support teams can deliver more personalized and informed assistance.
